During the final week of my Data Analyst training programme, I undertook a significant project with the objective of creating a list of American universities that could potentially form partnerships with INTO Universities. Although I initially felt dissatisfied with my initial work, I dedicated additional time to enhance the project, particularly focusing on improving the presentation. The refined version of the presentation is included in this portfolio.

To accomplish this project, I began by establishing specific criteria, such as university size and state location, to generate a shortlist of universities using Google BigQuery. Subsequently, I employed a weighted mean average method to identify the top 5 universities that would be the ideal match for INTO. Additionally, I developed a Power BI dashboard, which can be found at the conclusion of the presentation slides.
